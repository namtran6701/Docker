# build the image 
```
docker build -t welcome-app .
```

# check if the docker image is created

```
docker images
```

since we have already created the image, we can now instantiate the container

The command docker run -p 5000:5000 welcome-app is used to start a Docker container from the welcome-app image

- docker run: This is the command to start a new Docker container.
- -p 5000:5000: This is an option that publishes a container's port(s) to the host. In this case, it's mapping port 5000 of the host to port 5000 of the Docker container. The format is -p <host-port>:<container-port>. This means that the application inside the Docker container, which is listening on port 5000, can be accessed from your host machine on port 5000.
- welcome-app: This is the name of the Docker image to start the container from. In this case, it's the welcome-app image that was built using the docker build -t welcome-app . command.

# check how many containers are running

```
docker ps
```

# stop the docker container 

```
docker stop <container_id>
```
whatever docker image we have crated, we push that to the docker hub

# To login to docker, use 

```
docker login 
```

# remove a docker image 

```
docker image rm -f <image name>
```

# build a docker images (for pushing to docker hub later)
```
docker build -t <dockerhub_username>/<image_name> .
```

# rename a docker image
```
docker tag <old_image_name> <new_image_name>
```

# push the docker image to docker hub
```
docker push <dockerhub_username>/<image_name>:<tag> (tag could be latest or any other tag)
```

# pull a docker image from docker hub
